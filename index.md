## Description: 
Super Mario Survival pits Mario against a fire monster. The player needs to avoid touching the fire monster. The longer one survives, the higher the score.

## About Development:
Every aspect of this game was hand made. All code was written in Java. The game menu and the game over screen pictures where drawn using the wacom intuos drawing pad. The sprites were created using Aseprite [https://www.aseprite.org/](https://www.aseprite.org/). The fire monster uses an A star search algorimth to find the player and chase. If the player is confused on how to play, a help menu was also made that provides, directions and about the game.
